useEffect is a built-in hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in your functional components. Side effects can include data fetching, DOM manipulation, and more. Here's how you can use useEffect in React.....
.....
useEffect(() => {
  // Code to run when the component mounts
  // This is similar to componentDidMount in class components
}, []); // Empty dependency array means it will run only once on component mount....
useEffect takes two arguments: a callback function and an optional array of dependencies. The callback function contains the code you want to run as a side effect. The dependencies array is used to specify when the effect should run. If it's empty ([]), the effect runs only once when the component mounts....
.....
component need to do something after render....this will tell by useEffect hooks.....
What does useEffect do? By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative API.
example....just use useState to make a clickable to inc number....and same time i want a alert messsage...but it will not work....


i want such like it inc number then my alert msg shown up this will done by UseEffect  method....
.....
in the code talk about timing....it will be  first u get msg using uesEffect...
in second case u will get a alert msg once u clickde a button....case 1 is not related to click button.....in simple when render method will change useEffect Change automatically.....case 1
note...whenever we refresh our page it will be shown also when we will click the button....so passed an empty array so that it will show only once when we refresh our page....
....
const [num, setNum]= useState(0);
useEffect(()=>{
   alert("click msg") //case 1
},[])

const click=()=>{
  setNum(num+1)
   // alert("click msg") //case 2
}
and if we want to it shows to only particular element then u can pass the value to array like this in below...
const [num, setNum]= useState(0);
 const [nums, setNums]= useState(0);
useEffect(()=>{
   alert("click msg") //case 1
},[num])
